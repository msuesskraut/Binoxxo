//! Implements a recursive brute force puzzle generator.
//! First it generates a random and valid binoxxo board.
//! Then it takes fields away again (by setting them to `Empty`) and
//! returns the resulting incomplete board as puzzle.
//! Because the board was constructed from a valid board, there exists
//! at least one valid solution for the board.
